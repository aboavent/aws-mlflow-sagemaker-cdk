    "The main objective of this notebook is to show how you can integrate Amazon SageMaker and MLFlow and vice-versa.\n",

    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run successfully this notebook, you must have prepared the infrastructure using CDK, which setups up for you the MLFlow server in an isolated VPC. When running this example in the SageMaker Notebook instance provisioned via CDK, you need to have access to the URI of the MLFlow server we will use for tracking purposes. In our case, this corresponds to the `HTTP API Gateway` endpoint that exposes our MLFlow server reacheable via a `PrivateLink` and have a SageMaker execution role with permissions to access the secret in `Amazon SecretsManager` from where we retrieve the username and password to interact with the MLFlow server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs on SageMaker Studio using the `Base Python` image on a `Python 3` kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Machine Learning Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will solve a regression problem which aims to answer the question: \"what is the expected price of a house in the California area?\". The target variable is the house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install required and/or update libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, we have used the `sagemaker` SDK version 2. The MLFlow SDK library used is the one corresponding to our MLFlow server version, i.e., `1.23.1`"
